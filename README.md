### TerraWatts

#### TerraWatts is a web application based on the board game “Power Grid”, a multi-player, turn-based economic strategy game. We used D3.js, Firebase, and AngularJS to render maps and visualizations and Node.js and MongoDB to handle game logic.

#### Please visit www.terrawatts.space to see the deployed application. It may take a few seconds for our heroku server to wake up from sleep mode.
